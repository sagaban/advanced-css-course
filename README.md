# Advanced CSS Course

Code from the Udemy's course [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!
](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/)

## Project: Natours

### Requirements

 - yarn
 - live server ( `$ yarn global add live-server` )

### Get it running

You just have to compile the project (it will keep running, listening to changes)

`$ yarn compile:sass`

then go to the project folder ( `./natours` ) and run

`$ live-server`

this will get the project running at http://localhost:8080 by default, and every change we made in any files, will get the project re-compiled and the browser will automatically refresh the page.
